# About Sudoku-p3
Sudoku-P3 is a Python terminal game. It is deployed on heroku and uses a mock terminal made by Code institute. 

Users can play the classic game of Sudoku popularised by Maki Kaji.

Users can select an easy, medium or hard Sudoku puzzle to solve, get hints if they are stuck on a square, and after finishing the puzzle users can see correct solution as well as see how long it took to fill the board.
